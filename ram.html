        <h1><em>THE RAMAYANA</em></h1>
        <p> Lord Rama is one of the most powerful and loved heros in Hindu mythology. He is the son of Ayodhya King 
            Dasarat and the oldest of all brothers. His life is studied as a guide for humanity when anyone falls in 
            danger and hopelessness.
