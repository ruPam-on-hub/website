        <h1>THE RAMAYANA</h1>
        <p>The Ramayana is one of the largest ancient epics in world literature. 
            It consists of nearly 24,000 verses (mostly set in the Shloka/Anustubh meter), divided into 
            five kāṇḍas: the ayodhyakāṇḍa, the araṇyakāṇḍa, the kiṣkindakāṇḍa, the sundarākāṇḍa, and the
            laṅkākāṇḍa.
